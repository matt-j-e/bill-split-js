# Bill Splitter application

## Intro

I am writing this in February 2021 in the UK. The country has been in lockdown since Christmas and the prospect of going for a meal with a group of friends seems a long way off.

So why build a bill sharing application?

1. I'm a natural optimist; and
2. It's something of a rite passage for a JavaScript developer.

This week I am on a break from the Manchester Codes Software Engineer FastTrack Bootcamp, and I'm up to date with course work and projects. So I decided to have a crack at this.

## Technologies & languages

* Object Oriented vanilla JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Node & npm
* Jest
* Git and GitHub

## How does the app work?

* **Step 1** > Enter the names of the people in your party

* **Step 2** > Enter the full amount of the bill

* **Step 3** > Work your way down the bill. For each item, enter the price and then tick the box for each person who shared that particular item.

If somebody had a greater share than others then use the selection fields to set the appropriate ratio.

eg. Say there is an item on the bill for 5 bottles of lager and Miguel had 1 bottle while Jenny drank 4. When sharing that item in the app just select 4 for Jenny. That way she is allocated 4/5ths of the cost of that item on the bill.

* **Step 4** > When all items have been entered you are prompted to consider leaving a tip. The app shows you how much 5% and 10% would be but it's up to you how much you add. You can just leave the tip field blank if you're a cheapskate.

And that's it! You're presented with a list of everybody's share.

A job that normally takes 20 minutes with a pen, calculator, napkin and grimace is reduced to a 3 minute breeze!

The project is complete (to the extent that anything containing CSS is ever complete).
